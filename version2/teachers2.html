                    <h2>Rita Gekhman</h2>
		    <img src="images/rita.jpg" alt="Rita Gekhman" size="30%" />
                    <p>Rita Gekhman was born in Minsk Belarus. After attending a gymnastics school from age 7 to 13, she fell in love with ballroom after attending a competition in Vilnius. Soon after, she was accepted in a ballroom company and together with her partner she became one of the leading couples in Belarus. <br/>After immigrating to Israel in 1990, she became the first Israel Latin American amateur champions in 1991 with her partner Gena Kigher. They became the first Israel Latin American amateur champions in 1991. They represented Israel in the World Latin American Championship in Oslo, Norway. From then, she was Israel National Amateur Champion in Latin, Standard 10 dance and Classic Show dance divisions.<br/> In 1995 she turned Pro and starting dancing with a new partner, Garry Gekhman. she represented Israel in numerous World and European championships. In 1999 she moved to America and started working in an independent studio in New Jersey. She was eager to learn and develop further her dancing and technical knowledge. It was then when we started taking lessons abroad with the best teachers in the world: Michael and Vicky Barr, Marcus and Karen Hilton, Kenny and Marion Welsh to name a few.
<br/>In 2002 they became first couple to win US national open and close rising star Championships the same year. They started making rising star finals in England shortly after that. They made US national Championship finals twice. Their most memorable victories in open standard division in prestigious competitions such as Yankee Classic, World Masters, Philadelphia Dance festival, Constitution State Challenge, North East Invitational, Maryland Dance Sport Championship, Virginia State Championships just to name a few.
<br/>The highlight of her career was an invitation to perform the Robot Show dance in Blackpool 2008. That was her last public performance and she decided to retire from competitive dancing and focus on teaching and Judging. Just when I thought I would never dance again in front of a large audience as a professional, we received an invitation from the television show <q>Dancing with the Stars</q>. This was one of the best experiences of my dance life. </p><br/>
